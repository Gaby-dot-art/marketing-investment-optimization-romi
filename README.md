# Marketing ROMI Optimization — Showz Events

## Project Overview
This project analyzes marketing performance for **Showz Events** between **January 2017 and December 2018**.
The main objective is to optimize marketing investment by evaluating the relationship between customer acquisition costs and generated value, focusing on return-oriented decision making.

The analysis prioritizes **ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment)** as the key metric connecting marketing spend with business results.

---

## Business Context
Marketing budgets are limited, and not all acquisition channels generate sustainable value.
This project evaluates which traffic sources should be prioritized, monitored, or eliminated in order to maximize return and avoid inefficient spending.

---

## Metrics Used
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** Cost to acquire a user
- **LTV (Lifetime Value):** Revenue generated per user
- **ROMI:** Relationship between marketing investment and return

ROMI was selected as the primary decision metric because it directly links spending to profitability.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Findings
- A low CAC alone does **not** guarantee profitability if LTV is weak.
- ROMI provides a more accurate basis for marketing investment decisions by combining CAC and LTV.
- **Source 1** is the most profitable channel with a **ROMI of 2.99**, meaning every dollar invested generates nearly three dollars in return.
- **Source 2 (1.63)** and **Source 9 (1.49)** show solid positive returns with growth potential.
- **Source 10 (0.89)** and **Source 3 (0.43)** are not profitable and should be reduced or eliminated.

---

## Recommendations
- **Prioritize investment:** Source 1
- **Maintain and monitor:** Source 2 and Source 9
- **Proceed with caution:** Source 4 and Source 5
- **Reduce or eliminate:** Source 3 and Source 10

This strategy maximizes marketing efficiency and prevents budget waste.


---

## Conclusions
The analysis demonstrates that combining **CAC and LTV through ROMI** is critical for effective marketing optimization.
Focusing on ROMI enables data-driven decisions that align marketing investment with sustainable business growth.
